TODOs for EdgeSim (what’s still missing vs. current baseline)
============================================================

High-level targets
- Expose a user-friendly interface (CLI first, no “main aisle” magic).
- Improve explainability (edgesim-report).
- Add a Waymo-like viewer for recorded data.

1) Geometry fidelity (atomic, realistic defaults)
-------------------------------------------------
- Geometry profiles file for dimensions only (aisle widths, rack depths/heights, pallet footprints, crosswalk widths, buffers, dock door sizes).
- Use profiles only as defaults; explicit coords/sizes remain authoritative.
- Improve static geometry options: rack end caps, wall stubs for blind corners, safety zones, dock doors; all as coordinate-defined objects.
- Extend world.json metadata: id, type, role tags, (x1,y1,x2,y2), height, AABB for each object to aid checks/visuals.

2) Waymo-like viewer
--------------------
- edgesim_viewer.py (after full LiDAR logging exists):
  - Inputs: world.json, run_one.csv, actors.csv, lidar.npz (if logged), frames.json.
  - Reconstruct pose over time; render geometry + robot + LiDAR points (top-down 2D to start).
  - Playback controls: play/pause, step, slider; color by type or wet/dry.
  - Optional 3D mode (e.g., Open3D) behind a flag.
  - Integrate with CLI: edgesim replay <run_dir> --viewer [--follow-robot].

3) Robot path authoring & extra robot actor
-------------------------------------------
- Allow robot path via coordinates (like humans/vehicles): parse “robot from x0,y0 to x1,y1 …”, store as agent waypoints/raw_coords, project into aisles if enabled, and drive PID segment-to-segment instead of single start→goal.
- Add secondary robot actor (hazard/occluder): treat as a dynamic body with its own path/size, include in actors.csv/world.json, collide/occlude/scan like forklifts/humans, and keep AMR vs AMR collisions/event logging consistent.
4) Add more site and batch profiles
5) add different LiDAR heights
6) Fix falling object to spawn on any coordinates, not only in the middle (+ the puddle that spawns before it even landed, do we even need it?)
